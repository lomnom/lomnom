## WELCOME TO MY GITHUB PROFILE!
While You're here, check out my more useful projects!  
- `TERMINALFUNC`: A lower, less abstracted version of ncurses with much more potential
- `ESCAPES`: Just a tom of escape codes rolled into a big python class
- `FUNC`: code that I use in many projects. You can take anything useful from there
Also, if you're interested, i have many *totally useless* side projects!
- `PI`: inefficient pi calculator. Nice and colorful CLI tho
- `QUIZIZZ-ASSETS`: just a ton of assets from quizziz (music, icons etc etc)
- `CAH`: generate a cards against humanity deck
- `DADJOKES-lmaoo`: a bad dadjokes IOS app
- `NUTELLAA`: a TERRIBLE clicker game IOS app.
- `NUMBER-BOT-CLONE`: Trashy but usable clone of the discord `counting` bot, useful when the original goes down
- `microbit-pixel-art-maker`: a pixel art maker for the microbit, to prove my teachers that say "microbit can only display text" wrong
